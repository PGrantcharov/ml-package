# ml-package
#####Own implementations of four machine learning algorithms

Current algorithms included:
1) Linear Regression

    i) Standard least squares regression
    
    ii) Ridge regression
2) Logistic Regression
    
    i) Standard solver
    
    ii) Newton-method solver (2nd degree approximati)
    
3) K-Nearest Neighbors
4) Naive Bayes


To complement these algorithms, this package also 
contains methods performing functions such as:
1) Train-Test splits
2) Cross validation
3) Test set prediction
4) Confusion matrix calculator
5) Accuracy score calculator
6) RMSE score calculator
7) Polynomial feature expansions
